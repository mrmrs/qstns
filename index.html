        People use the internet to consume information, and more often than not, that just means reading words on a screen. Too many websites make this harder than it should be. Let's fix that. If we deliver on the following promises to users, the internet will be a much better place.

            For a single-column design measure should lie between 40 &amp; 80 characters. Many typographers consider the perfect measure to be 65 characters.

            This paragraph is set to a max-width of 800px which is roughly 75 characters per line (except when viewed on screens smaller than 800px wide). At the beginning of every new line the reader is focused, but this focus gradually wears off over the duration of the line which is why good measure increases readability.

          <h1 class="f4 sansserif uppercase kerning-s">This is Bad</h1>
          <p class="cp wrap wrap-l mb--1-5">
Measure can create unity and harmony within a design, but a long measure disrupts the rhythm. If a line of text is too long the userâ€™s eye will have a hard time focusing on the text. This is because the length makes it difficult to get an idea of where the line starts and ends. Furthermore it can be difficult to continue from the correct line in large blocks of text.

     #TODO : Find good and bad examples of measure

<pre>
 - Is your main copy 16px or larger?
 - Can you tab through navigation links
 - Are images responsive (they never bleed off the viewport)
 - Tap targets are large enough
</pre>

    What are we trying to get the user to do?
    How far away will people be from the content?
    What platform / devices?
    Can the user find what info they want quickly and easily?
    Is this maintainable?
    Can someone else change this without losing their $#*!ing mind
    Is this under version control?
    How much time do we have?
    What is the scope?
    What order do we want to do things
    What are the users / customers expectations
    Does this make our users trust us more or less?
    Icons vs text + accessibility
    Where does the eye lead on the page
    Are we speaking to our customer in the way they want to be spoken to?
    This font that I chose, is it readable by people who are dyslexic?
    List of popular web fonts
    - Does your font render properly on a browser?
    Does HTML Validate?
    What is my user trying to do / trying to accomplish
    Do we have content to get started?
    Do they know what they are trying to do?
    What is my site like on a screen reader
